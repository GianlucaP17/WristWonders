## Features<a name="features"></a>

1. **Overview of the Best Brands**: The app showcases various watch brands, each offering unique and stylish designs. You can explore these brands and view detailed specifications and features of individual watches.

2. **Save Favorites**: Easily save your favorite watches by tapping on the app. This feature allows you to create a personalized list of preferred timepieces for quick access.

3. **API Integration**<a name="api-integration"></a>: The app communicates with our WatchBase API using HTTP requests to retrieve watch data. The integration ensures that the app remains up-to-date with the latest watch information.

4. **Local Data Storage**<a name="local-data-storage"></a>: To enhance user experience and provide offline access, the app utilizes a local caching mechanism. This mechanism allows you to store watch data locally, enabling access to the catalog even without an internet connection. We have implemented the Shared Preferences technique for efficient local storage.

5. **State Management**<a name="state-management"></a>: The app employs a state management system to handle its state and data. This approach enables you to mark individual watches as favorites, creating a personalized list tailored to your preferences.

6. **Error Handling**<a name="error-handling"></a>: The app features proper error handling techniques to ensure a smooth user experience. Error messages and notifications guide users in case of any unexpected issues, ensuring the app remains stable and reliable.

7. **Thorough Testing**<a name="testing"></a>: The app has undergone extensive testing to guarantee its functionality and performance. We have covered various scenarios to ensure that all features work as intended, providing you with a reliable and bug-free application.

8. **Documentation and Instructions**<a name="documentation"></a>: Detailed documentation, including this Readme.md file, has been prepared for future developers and anyone interested in understanding the app's architecture. The documentation provides instructions on running the app and additional information that may be helpful for further development or maintenance.

9. **Presentation Skills**<a name="presentation"></a>: The app's user interface is visually appealing, intuitive, and easy to navigate. We believe that the combination of functionality and aesthetics delivers an exceptional user experience.

10. **Summary**<a name="summary"></a>: To create the WristWonders app, I followed a series of steps. First, I set up the project structure and organized the code. Then, I implemented endpoint services to interact with the APIs and populate the app's models.
Next, I designed and developed the user interface, including a menu at the top to display watch brands fetched from the "brands" API. When a brand is selected, the corresponding watches are loaded into the "collection" section, utilizing the "watches" API.
Upon selecting a watch from the collection, the app retrieves detailed information using a dedicated API based on the watch's ID. The details are displayed to the user.
In the watch details screen, there is a button to save the watch to the "favorites" section. This is achieved by utilizing a local storage system like "Shared Preferences."
The "favorites" section contains a list of user-saved watches, allowing for removal if desired. Selecting a watch from the favorites list retrieves specific information using the dedicated API with the watch's ID.
Overall, the WristWonders app enables users to explore watch brands, view individual watch details, and save favorites for future access.
