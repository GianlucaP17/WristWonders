**WristWonders Catalog App Presentation**

Hello everyone,

Today, I am pleased to present to you WristWonders our new Watch Catalog App. â€¨This app has been developed using the Flutter framework, which allows us to create beautiful and responsive user interfaces across different platforms. Let's dive into the features of our app.

**2. Overview of the Best Brands:**
Our app provides an overview of the best watch brands, as first, of course, Swatch. You can explore various brands, each offering unique and stylish designs. At the user Tap, the app showcases the different watches in detail, allowing you to view their specifications and features.

**3. Save Favorites:**
We understand that some watches might catch your eye, so we've included a feature that allows you to save your favorite watches. With a simple tap, you can add a watch to your favorites list for easy access later on.

**4. API Integration:**
To retrieve watch data, the app uses HTTP requests to communicate with our API WatchBase. We have an API key that authenticates the app and ensures secure data retrieval. This integration enables us to keep the app up-to-date with the latest watch information.

**5. Local Data Storage:**
To enhance user experience and provide offline access, we've implemented a local caching mechanism within the app. This mechanism allows you to store watch data locally, ensuring that even when you're in another country without an internet connection, you can still access the catalog and show it to local Swatch shops and buy a brand new Watch. We have chosen the most suitable approach for local storage, utilizing the technique Shared Preferences.

**6. State Management:**
WristWonders App use a state management system to handle the app's state and data. With this approach, you can mark individual watches as favorites, creating a personalized list of your preferred timepieces.

**7. Error Handling:**
We understand the importance of providing a smooth user experience, even when things go wrong. That's why we have implemented proper error handling techniques throughout the app. Error messages and notifications will guide users in case of any unexpected issues, ensuring that the app remains stable and reliable.

**8. Thorough Testing:**
To guarantee the functionality and performance of the app, we have conducted thorough testing. Our testing process covers various scenarios to ensure that all features work as intended. By conducting these tests, we can provide you with a reliable and bug-free application.

**9. Documentation and Instructions:**
For future developers or anyone interested in understanding the app's architecture, we have prepared detailed documentation, including a Readme.md file. The documentation will guide you on how to run the app and provide additional information that may be helpful for further development or maintenance.

**10. Presentation Skills:**
Lastly, as part of our commitment to delivering a high-quality product, we have considered the importance of effective presentation skills. We have ensured that the app's user interface is visually appealing, intuitive, and easy to navigate. We believe that the combination of functionality and aesthetics will provide an exceptional user experience.

In conclusion, the WristWonders App offers a delightful experience for watch enthusiasts, providing an extensive catalog of watches, the ability to save favorites, offline access, and a seamless user interface. With thorough testing and proper documentation, we are confident in the app's functionality and performance.

**11. Techinical step by step:**
To create the WristWonders app, I followed a series of steps. 

First, I set up the project structure and organized the code.

Then, I implemented endpoint services to interact with the APIs and populate the app's models. 

Next, I designed and developed the user interface, including a menu at the top to display watch brands fetched from the "brands" API. 

When a brand is selected, the corresponding watches are loaded into the "collection" section, utilizing the "watches" API. 

Upon selecting a watch from the collection, the app retrieves detailed information using a dedicated API based on the watch's ID. The details are displayed to the user. In the watch details screen, there is a button to save the watch to the "favorites" section. This is achieved by utilizing a local storage system like "Shared Preferences." 

The "favorites" section contains a list of user-saved watches, allowing for removal if desired. Selecting a watch from the favorites list retrieves specific information using the dedicated API with the watch's ID. Overall, the WristWonders app enables users to explore watch brands, view individual watch details, and save favorites for future access.

Later i started writing a readme.md file in github to help other dev to use the sourcecode, and wrote down notes to keep in mind during the presentation.

Stay tuned for the next update of the WristWonders app, where these exciting features will be available, making your watch browsing and shopping experience even more convenient and enjoyable! Here's a sneak peek:
